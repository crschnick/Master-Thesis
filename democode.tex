In case \LuaLaTeX{} is used as compiler, there is no ligature at \qq{f\/l} in the word \qq{dwarflike} (in contrast to \qq{fl} at \qq{workflow}).
In other words: \qq{dwarflike} and \qq{dwarf\/like} look the same in the PDF.
In case they do not, there is an issue with Lua\LaTeX{} and the selnolig package.
